<h1 align="center">Backend for Weather Backcast</h1>

## Description

This is the backend for the Weatherbackcast app. It is a simple API that returns the weather backcast that was stored. I made this a school project.

## What it can do

- you can log-in
- you can register
- you can get the weather backcast
- as admin, you can add a new weather backcast

## What I want to add

- connect it to a database
- connect it to the [frontend](https://github.com/oliver-oswald/Weatherfrontcast)
- currently it's only a terminal app, I want to make it a web app
